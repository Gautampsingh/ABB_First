Annotations
-----------
Annotation feature of python enables you to add additional explanatory metadata about the arguments declared in a function definition and also the return data type

Annotations are considered by python interpreter while executing the code.

They are mainly used for python IDE's for providing detailed documentation to the programmer

To check the annotations there is a static type checker

Marshalling and Data Persistence
--------------------------------

Marshalling
-----------
Marshalling refers to the process of transforming in-memory objects into a byte stream that can be stored or transmitted and then reconstructing the object from the byte stream later.

Its a form of serialization is primarily used for internal python object persistence or transfer especially in contexts like inter-process communication or caching.

we have a marshal module for this purpose

import marshal


FLASK
-----
flask is a micro web framework for Python, designed to be lightweight and flexible for building web applications. It provides essential tool and features such as routing and request handling without enforcing a specific structure or requiring extensive boiler plate code. Flask's minimalistic design allows developers to have more control over the application's components making it suitable for both small and complex projects it is based on the Werkzeug WSGI (web server gateway interface) toolkit and Jinja2 templating engine.
